# Financial Literacy Tutorial
## Team Members: Luna, Nirantheri, Isabel

This tutorial introduces students to essential concepts in personal finance and portfolio analysis through a computational and data-driven approach.

Many individuals recognize the importance of saving and investing but lack practical, data-driven skills to make informed financial decisions. While general financial advice is common, few tutorials teach how to model outcomes, optimize strategies, and make decisions under uncertainty.
Thereâ€™s a critical gap between knowing "I should save and invest" and understanding how to analyze different options computationally to maximize financial outcomes over time.
This tutorial directly addresses that gap by combining financial literacy with hands-on computational tools for modeling, simulation, and optimization.
