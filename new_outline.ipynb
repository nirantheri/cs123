    "### Introduction: Applying Computational Thinking to Personal Finance and Portfolio Analysis\n",
    "In an era where financial independence is closely tied to the ability to make strategic investment decisions, understanding the mechanics of saving and investing has become a critical life skill. Yet, while many individuals understand the importance of saving, few have the tools or knowledge required to evaluate how different financial strategies—and especially investment decisions—impact long-term outcomes. This tutorial addresses that gap by introducing students to essential concepts in personal finance and portfolio analysis through a computational and data-driven approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial begins by building a foundation in core savings principles. Learners will explore the functionality of common financial instruments such as high-yield savings accounts, 401(k)s, and Roth IRAs. Through interactive inputs and simulations, students will see how interest rates, compound growth, and tax advantages affect returns over time. These early exercises aim to demonstrate the value of starting early, contributing consistently, and choosing the right savings vehicles for one’s personal financial goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this foundation, the tutorial then transitions into a more advanced, investment-focused module: constructing and evaluating a personalized stock portfolio. Students will be guided through the process of:\n",
    "- Selecting their own breakdown of stocks to form a diversified portfolio based on individual risk preferences or interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluating the strength of their chosen portfolio using historical data and key financial metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulating potential future outcomes through Monte Carlo simulations, which model thousands of possible future scenarios to account for uncertainty and market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimizing the stock allocation using algorithmic methods that balance return potential with risk, aiming for the most efficient use of investment capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rechecking the portfolio’s strength after optimization, to reflect the improvements made and demonstrate the impact of computational adjustments on financial performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, students will employ principles from computer science—such as data modeling, simulations, algorithmic thinking, and data visualization—to analyze financial data and make informed decisions. By the end of the tutorial, students will have developed not only a deeper understanding of financial literacy but also a practical appreciation for how computational tools can empower individuals to manage their personal wealth more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interdisciplinary exploration is designed to equip learners with a strong foundation in both personal finance and applied computation—skills that are increasingly essential in today’s data-rich, financially complex world."

Despite its name, the minimize function works by minimizing the constraints that you give it, so minimizing the difference between our portfolio return and our target return will enable us to hit our target return, \"maximizing\" the output of our portfolio. If we want to truly maximize, we can continue pushing up this target return incrementally until we reach it!.\n",
