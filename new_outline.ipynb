        "### Introduction: Applying Computational Thinking to Personal Finance and Portfolio Analysis\n",
        "In an era where financial independence is closely tied to the ability to make strategic investment decisions, understanding the mechanics of saving and investing has become a critical life skill. Yet, while many individuals understand the importance of saving, few have the tools or knowledge required to evaluate how different financial strategies—and especially investment decisions—impact long-term outcomes. This tutorial addresses that gap by introducing students to essential concepts in personal finance and portfolio analysis through a computational and data-driven approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial begins by building a foundation in core savings principles. Learners will explore the functionality of common financial instruments such as high-yield savings accounts, 401(k)s, and Roth IRAs. Through interactive inputs and simulations, students will see how interest rates, compound growth, and tax advantages affect returns over time. These early exercises aim to demonstrate the value of starting early, contributing consistently, and choosing the right savings vehicles for one’s personal financial goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Building on this foundation, the tutorial then transitions into a more advanced, investment-focused module: constructing and evaluating a personalized stock portfolio. Students will be guided through the process of:\n",
        "- Selecting their own breakdown of stocks to form a diversified portfolio based on individual risk preferences or interests.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Evaluating the strength of their chosen portfolio using historical data and key financial metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simulating potential future outcomes through Monte Carlo simulations, which model thousands of possible future scenarios to account for uncertainty and market volatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Optimizing the stock allocation using algorithmic methods that balance return potential with risk, aiming for the most efficient use of investment capital.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Rechecking the portfolio’s strength after optimization, to reflect the improvements made and demonstrate the impact of computational adjustments on financial performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this tutorial, students will employ principles from computer science—such as data modeling, simulations, algorithmic thinking, and data visualization—to analyze financial data and make informed decisions. By the end of the tutorial, students will have developed not only a deeper understanding of financial literacy but also a practical appreciation for how computational tools can empower individuals to manage their personal wealth more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "This interdisciplinary exploration is designed to equip learners with a strong foundation in both personal finance and applied computation—skills that are increasingly essential in today’s data-rich, financially complex world."

These simulations work by finding a daily return, done by determining the change in a stock from day to day and taking a natural logarithm. Then, we calculate the \"drift,\" or upward/downward tendency of a stock, using the equation $Drift = Average(Daily Return) - 0.5 * Variance(Daily Return)$, and a random input by using the equation $Random = StdDev(Daily Return) * random(0, 1)$, which multiplies standard deviation by a random value from 0 to 1. Finally, we sum together these two values we've calculated, and for any given day $S_i$ the price of a stock on that day of simulation is $S_i = S_{i-1} * e ^ {Drift + Random}$.

It would be even better if we could take the portfolio we made and see if we can change our investment amounts to maximize our returns. There are a couple steps to get it set up, but thankfully, scipy has a function that can maximize our returns given an initial investment percentage for each stock, and a history of each stock's percentage change in price. We utilized [this medium article](https://medium.com/@ethan.duong1120/python-powered-portfolio-optimization-achieving-target-returns-through-weight-optimization-fc5163e5c9c6) as our framework.\n",

Then, we use the pct_change function to determine the change between each frame for each stock, allowing us to determine the most efficient investment of stocks."

        "Now, we need to start bounding the function that will maximize our returns given an investment. We will use scipy's minimize function to do this. Despite its name, the minimize function works by minimizing the constraints that you give it, so minimizing the difference between our portfolio return and our target return will enable us to hit our target return, \"maximizing\" the output of our portfolio. If we want to truly maximize, we can continue pushing up this target return incrementally until we reach it!.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we will start with initial weights of each stock in our portfolio. We can either use the weights we selected previously, or we can simply start with each stock having an equal weight in our portfolio. You can choose this by slightly modifying the code below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we need to set our target return value, which we selected to arbitrarily be .2, or a 20% return. This can be modified however you wish, but do note that the minimize function will fail if maximizing to the given return percentage is impossible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important goal is to bound the weight of each stock in our portfolio between 0 and 1, or 0% and 100%. It doesn't make much sense to be able to buy more than a full portfolio of stocks! We do this by creating a tuple that has the same length as our number of stocks, and each element in the tuple is another tuple storing the values (0,1), bounding our stock weights in that range\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we want to create two constraints for the function. This is done using the syntax below. Our first constraint says that the sum of all weights should not exceed 1, or that our portfolio weights can't exceed 100%. We've done this already for individual stocks, but it's also important that we cant just spend 100% of our money in each stock. Finally, we also need to make sure that we \"minimize\" the difference between the returns for any set of portfolio weights the function generates and the target return we have set."

        "\n",
        "After constructing our initial stock portfolio based on user-selected allocations, we evaluated its historical performance using metrics like annual return, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown. This gave us a baseline understanding of how well our portfolio performed under those weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then used optimization techniques (via scipy.minimize) to automatically adjust the stock allocations in order to achieve a target return while minimizing risk. This step simulates what a financial algorithm might do to make our portfolio more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we re-evaluated the optimized portfolio using the same performance metrics. By comparing the before-and-after results, we can see whether the optimization actually improved our portfolio — either by increasing returns, reducing risk, or improving the Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted performance).\n",
        "\n",
        "This comparison demonstrates the power of computational thinking in making data-driven investment decisions."
